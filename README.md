# UDP Client and UDP Server Implementation

This implementation was based on the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0gRbLRefR0

You can build and run each one by the following commands:

```shell
# It will build and run the server on port 4457
$ make run-server
```

```shell
# It will build and run the client on localhost for port 4457
$ make run-client
```
